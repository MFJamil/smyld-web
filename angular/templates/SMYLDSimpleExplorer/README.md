The Simple Explorer Template is created using Angular 8 and Angular Material library. 

This template can be used by developers to speed up creating a new project. The template looks like below:

What is actually shown are two place holder modules "Module1" and "Module2", they will be included in the template source code as a guid for the developer on how to integrate thier own modules inside the template.

## Features List

### Simple Theme 

By selecting the settings as shown below:

the theme color can be updated, although this looks simple but it updates angular material components themsevles to reflect the newly selected color.

### Messages Panel

The template includes a messages panel that shows the different logging messages categorized as (INFO, ERROR and WARNING), each will be displayed with a proper icon. The messages panel is shown at the bottom of the screen and with hovering the mouse over it, will fade in and slide upwards to show the messages, upon another hovering of the mouse the panel will go back to its place.

### Developer's question : How to use it?


#### 1 - Downloading the template
Since Github does not support the direct download of a specific folder in the repository but provides the clone for the whole repository, we can not download this template without cloning the whole respository which is not unwieldy. 
However there are several ways to get around that, as shown below:

##### via Subversion!
Yes! via Subversion this is possible, just run the following command below:
``` Shell
svn co https://github.com/MFJamil/smyld/trunk/angular/templates/SMYLDSimpleExplorer
```
##### via Codeload!
Another way of filtering out the repository via the codeload link, just run the following command below:
``` Shell
curl https://codeload.github.com/mfjamil/smyld/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=3 smyld-master/angular/templates/SMYLDSimpleExplorer
```
